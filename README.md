# RequirementParser


A excel file is given as an input to this project , cosisting of functional and non-functional requirements to this project. This project reads that excel file in .csv format and sorts it out depending on the structure of the csv file and gives out a tree view on the display window with the ability to select the test cases. Based on the selected test cases, the program generates a bare-minimum test case for the tester.

This project is open-sourse and anyone can use it personally as well as commercially without any constraints.
